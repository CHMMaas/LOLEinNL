# The evolution of the loss of life expectancy in patients with solid malignancies: a population-based study in the Netherlands, 1989-2019

**Background**

Population-based cancer survival is generally measured within a fixed period post-diagnosis (e.g., 5-year relative survival). We aimed to assess the impact of cancer on the complete patient’s lifespan with a nationwide, population-based study. 

**Methods**

From the Netherlands Cancer Registry, we selected adult (≥18 years) patients diagnosed with one of 17 leading solid malignancies in the Netherlands during 1989-2019 (n=1,832,244), with survival follow-up until the end of 2021. We used flexible parametric relative survival models to estimate the loss of life expectancy (LOLE), the proportional LOLE (PLOLE), and the conditional LOLE (CLOLE), the latter we estimate to study the LOLE after surviving several years post-diagnosis. These estimates were calculated by cancer type, year, age, sex, and disease stage.

**Findings**

For all cancers combined, the LOLE consistently decreased from 1989 to 2019. However, the magnitude of this decrease varied across cancer types, sex, age, and disease stage. The LOLE decreased most over time for 65-year-old patients with cancer of the prostate and female breast, and the least for 65-year-old patients with cancer of the head and neck, and squamous cell carcinoma. For all cancers combined, the LOLE of 65-year-old patients decreased irrespective of disease stage, irrespective of sex. However, the decrease was less pronounced for distant disease. For all cancers combined, CLOLE estimates suggest that patients with cancer lose fewer life years with each additional year survived post-diagnosis, irrespective of sex and age.

**Interpretation**

The decreasing LOLE estimates from 1989 to 2019 in the Netherlands indicates a reduced impact of a cancer diagnosis on life expectancy. Nevertheless, the prognosis of some malignancies remains poor in contemporary clinical practice, particularly those diagnosed with distant disease, indicating the need to advance cancer diagnosis and treatment. Life expectancy estimates complement relative survival estimates to assess progress in the effectiveness of oncological care.
